Welcome to the online dcumentation for COMETS - Computation Of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space. 

COMETS is a software platform for performing computer simulations of spatially structured microbial communities. It is based on stoichiometric modeling of the genome-scale metabolic network of individual microbial species using dynamic flux balance analysis, and on a discrete approximation of diffusion. For more information, see [Harcombe et al., Metabolic Resource Allocation in Individual Microbes Determines Ecosystem Interactions and Spatial Dynamics, Cell Reports, 2014](http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00280-0).

COMETS is built and maintained by the [Daniel Segre Lab](http://www.bu.edu/segrelab/) at Boston University.

COMETS is open-source software. If you are interested in contributing to the development of COMETS and would like to obtain a copy of the code, please contact us: [comets@bu.edu](mailto:comets@bu.edu?Subject=COMETS%20development)
