   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at
   least contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. The toctree directive controls what links are in the "Navigation" bar
   at the top of each page. The "maxdepth" argument determines how many
   levels deep the links are shown. The "caption" argument determines the
   title of the "Navigation" bar.

Introduction
============

What is COMETSpy?
----------------------------
COMETS is a software platform for performing **computer simulations of
metabolism in spatially structured microbial communities**. It is based on
stoichiometric modeling of the genome-scale metabolic network of
individual microbial species (using dynamic flux balance analysis), and
on a discrete approximation of convection-diffusion equations.

COMETSpy is a Python package that provides a user-friendly interface to
COMETS. It allows users to easily set up and run simulations, and to
analyze the results. COMETSpy is designed to be used in conjunction with
COMETS. It is not a standalone package, and requires COMETS to be
installed on the user's computer.

How to use this Documentation:
------------------------------

This documentation is meant to aide users in installing COMETSpy and
using COMETSpy to run simulations and analyze the results. If you need
help and do not easily find an answer in this documentation, ask your question
in a `new issue on GitHub <https://github.com/segrelab/cometspy/issues/new>`_.
**Any question that you have likely indicates a shortcoming in the documentation,
which we will want to fix!**

Find the module/class/function that you are interested in using in the
table of contents on the left or in the following indices, click on the link to
go to the appropriate documentation:

* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`genindex`

For a class, the documentation will include a brief description of the class,
the parameters that the class takes, and a list of all attributes, and examples
of how to use the class. The documentation will also include a list of all
the methods that are available for that class.

For a function, including the methods for a class, the documentation will 
include a description of what the function does, a list of the parameters that
the function takes and the objects that the function returns, and examples of
how to use the function.
